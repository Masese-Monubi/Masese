# Simple Web Portfolio Project

## Project Purpose and Goal
This repository serves as a minimal, static web presence designed to showcase basic front-end development skills using only HTML and CSS. Its primary purpose for this assignment is to provide a standardized, simple structure for automated analysis and summarization by a Jac agent.

## Key Features
* **Structure:** Contains one primary page (`index.html`) and one dedicated style sheet (`style.css`).
* **Modularity:** The core project logic and styling are kept completely separate.
* **Tools:** Includes no complex frameworks, relying purely on static files for quick deployment.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
The project requires no installation steps or build tools. To view the website:
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
